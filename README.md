# Flask REST API – User Management

This project is part of my Python Internship.  
It is a simple **REST API** built using **Flask** that performs CRUD operations on user data.

The API uses an **in-memory dictionary** to store users and supports:

- GET → Fetch users  
- POST → Create a new user  
- PUT → Update user details  
- DELETE → Remove a user  

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of backend API development.
